## Foundations of AI

- **What is AI?**  
  AI refers to systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, perception, and decision-making.
- **Types of AI:**  
  - Narrow AI (e.g., language models, image classifiers)
  - General AI (hypothetical, human-level intelligence)
- [Stanford’s AI Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Andrew Ng)
- [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) (Beginner-friendly)
